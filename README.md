## Privacy

Your data stays on your device. MpesaLens processes everything locally in your browser and doesn't store, upload, or transmit your statements anywhere. No account required, no personal information collected.

## Important Notes

**Categorization Accuracy**  
MpesaLens automatically categorizes transactions based on M-Pesa descriptions. Since these descriptions can vary, some transactions may be miscategorized. You can always expand any category to see the full list of transactions and verify the details.

**For Business Users**  
If you use M-Pesa for business, MpesaLens works with SME (Pochi Merchant) accounts. Mixed personal and business transactions are normal and will appear in the analysis.

**Performance**  
Large statements covering many months may take longer to process. The app works best on Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

---

## Troubleshooting

**PDF won't upload**  
Verify you're using an official M-Pesa statement from Safaricom and that your password is correct.

**Unexpected categories**  
Expand the category sections to view all transaction details. M-Pesa transaction descriptions can be inconsistent.

**Missing transactions**  
Some older statement formats may not be fully recognized. Check the expandable sections to see what was processed.
